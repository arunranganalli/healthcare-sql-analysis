# Healthcare Data Insights with SQL: Patient, Allergy & Medication Analysis
"SQL project analyzing patient data and medications using PostgreSQL"

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to clean, analyze, and derive insights from real-world healthcare data.
We work with multiple CSV datasets (patients, allergies, medications) and use SQL to:

âœ… Create tables and import raw data

âœ… Clean and transform data into meaningful tables

âœ… Run analysis queries to extract key insights

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

01_create_tables.sql       -- SQL scripts to create tables

02_import_data.sql         -- SQL scripts to import CSV data

03_clean_data.sql          -- SQL scripts to clean and prepare data

04_analysis_queries.sql    -- SQL queries to analyze the data

ðŸ“Š Key Insights Generated

âœ” Top allergies by patient count

âœ” Patient distribution by city/state

âœ” Average medication costs

âœ”  Overall allergy distribution per city (top 10)

âœ”  Frequently used medications for specific allergies

âœ”  Top 10 Medications by Average Cost

ðŸ’¡ Learnings

âœ… Hands-on practice with SQL (CREATE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, aggregate functions).

âœ… Data cleaning and transformation in SQL.

âœ… Generating insights that can support better healthcare decisions.
